## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- There are issues that only occur on Heroku but not on localhost, e.g.: I forgot to add `tether` as a dependencies in `application.js`; everything is fine when running on localhost, but on Heroku, I cant delete articles because of errors in javascript.
- LICEcap does not work. I tried some other GIF maker applications but they are all commercial apps, or have a limit of the length of the GIF (mostly around 30 seconds)
